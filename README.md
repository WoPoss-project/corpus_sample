# Sample of the WoPoss corpus
The folder [data](https://github.com/WoPoss-project/corpus_sample/tree/main/data) contains two TEI-compliant files with the annotation of _De spectaculis_ by Tertullian and _Octavius_ by M. Minucius Felix. 

The folder [aux](https://github.com/WoPoss-project/corpus_sample/tree/main/aux) contains a TEI-compliant file with an excerpt of the metadata index file of the project. This file presents the basic metadata of a number of authors and works that are being annotated in the framework of the project.
